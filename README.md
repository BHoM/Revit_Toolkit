# Revit_Toolkit

A set of tools enabling exchange of information between BHoM and [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview):
- communication between BHoM and Revit via the Adapter, `RevitListener` plugin and sockets
- `ToRevit` and `FromRevit` conversion
- a set of utility methods supporting conversion and processing of Revit elements

### Known Versions of Software Supported
Autodesk Revit 2018  
Autodesk Revit 2019  
Autodesk Revit 2020  

### Documentation
For more information about functionality see [Revit_Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/Revit_Toolkit/wiki).

This toolkit is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. Find out more on our [wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki) or at [https://bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz/)

## Quick Start ðŸš€ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers ðŸ¤– 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! ðŸ˜„ 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Getting-started-for-developers)

You will need the following to build Revit_Toolkit:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework
    - .NET Framework 4.5.2 for Revit 2018
    - .NET Framework 4.7.2 for Revit 2019
    - .NET Framework 4.7.2 for Revit 2020
- [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM)
- [BHoM_Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine)
- [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter)
- [Socket_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Socket_Toolkit)

Revit_Toolkit needs to be built separately for each version of Revit. To switch between version-specific Revit_Toolkit configurations use Configuration Manager:  
Debug2018 -> Revit 2018  
Debug2019 -> Revit 2019  
Debug2020 -> Revit 2020
